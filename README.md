# Connect Four

This repository contains a web-based implementation of the classic game Connect Four, built with Typescript, React, Tailwindcss, zustand, and vitejs. The goal of the project is to provide a fun and interactive way for developers to improve their knowledge and skills in these technologies.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple yet engaging example of a web application that uses modern front-end technologies. By studying and building upon the code in this repository, developers can learn how to:

- Use Typescript to write type-safe and maintainable code
- Build a responsive user interface with React components and hooks
- Apply custom styling using Tailwindcss utility classes
- Manage state using the zustand state management library
- Optimize performance using the vitejs build tool

The project also serves as a starting point for developers who want to create their own games or applications using similar technologies.
